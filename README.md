# WorkingKats

WorkingKats is a online employee time clock system. It is designed for Sam Houston students, but can be implemented in any workplace or school.

------

## Why WorkingKats?

- Have you ever lost your id you use to clock in/out with?
- Has your boss ever been too busy or never in their office to ask off work?
- Have you ever experienced putting the trust in someone elses hands to handle your timesheet, which results in your paycheck?

### Workingkats will solve those problems!

WorkingKats is an application built with Java, that utilizes an online employee/manager time clock system.  The main goal is to give the manager an accurate and powerfull system to track their employee hours and time schedule.

If a student is new, and is looking for a job, then after they sign up, they can search for the departments they wish to work in, and contact that specific Manager. It also allows the managers to check on their employees timesheets and keep them accountable.

If a new manager is hired, they can also create an account. But they will not be connected to a student until an administrator assigns them a department.
