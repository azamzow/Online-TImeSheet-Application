# Online-TImeSheet-Application

## This is an application that is for Sam Houston State Students who work for SHSU. 
## It allows students to login and clock in/out. They can also view their managers contact information in case they need to contact them. 
## If a student is new and is looking for a job, then after they sign up, they can search for the departments they wish to work in, and contact that specific Manager.

## It also allows the managers to login and check on their employees timesheets. 
## If a new manager is hired, they can also create an account. But they will not be tied to a student until an administrator changes that.
