## Why WorkingKats?
- Have you ever lost your id you use to clock in/out with?
- Has your boss ever been too busy or never in their office to ask off work?
- Have you ever experienced putting the trust in someone elses hands to handle your timesheet, which results in your paycheck?
- Are you tired of waiting just to clock in/out?


# Workingkats will solve those problems!

WorkingKats is an application built with Java, that allows online employee/manager time clock system.  The main goal is to give you an accurate and powerfull system for tracking your employee hours and time. 
If a student is new, and is looking for a job, then after they sign up, they can search for the departments they wish to work in, and contact that specific Manager.
It also allows the managers to login and check on their employees timesheets.
If a new manager is hired, they can also create an account. But they will not be connected to a student until an administrator assigns them a department.
